Digitizing medical reports
Just upload the photo of medical reports. The system uses OCR and segregates the data into a key-value store. The aim is to create a repository of medical reports along with annotations (possibly from doctors). This can help with patient's history management. More importantly the data can be anonymised and used for medical discoveries.
